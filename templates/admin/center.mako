<h2>Administration</h2>

<p>The menu on the left provides the following features</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Security</strong>
        <p/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Manage users</strong> - provides a view of the registered users and all groups and non-private roles associated 
                with each user.  
            </li>
            <p/>
            <li>
                <strong>Manage groups</strong> - provides a view of all groups along with the members of the group and the roles associated with
                each group (both private and non-private roles).  Non-private roles include a link to a page that allows you to manage the users
                and groups that are associated with the role.  The page also includes a view of the data library datasets that are associated with the
                role and the permissions applied to each dataset.
            </li>
            <p/>
            <li>
                <strong>Manage roles</strong> - provides a view of all non-private roles along with the role type, and the users and groups that
                are associated with the role.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p/>
    <li><strong>Data</strong>
        <p/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Manage data libraries</strong> - Data libraries enable a Galaxy administrator to upload datasets into a data library.  Currently,
                only administrators can create data libraries, but permission to perform the following functions on the data library can be granted to
                users (a library item is one of: a data library, a library folder, a library dataset).
                <p/>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>add library item</strong> - Role members can add library items to this data library or folder</li>
                    <li><strong>modify library item</strong> - Role members can modify this library item</li>
                    <li><strong>manage library permissions</strong> - Role members can manage permissions applied to this library item</li>
                </ul>
                <p/>
                The default behavior is for no permissions to be applied to a data library item, but applied permissions are inherited downward, so it is
                important to set desired permissions on a new data library when it is created.  When this is done, new folders and datasets added to the
                data library will automatically inherit those permissions.  In the same way, permissions can be applied to a folder, which will be 
                automatically inherited by all contained datasets and sub-folders.
                <p/>
                The "Data Libraries" menu item allows users to access the datasets in a data library as long as they are not restricted from accessing them.
                Importing a library dataset into a history will not make a copy of the dataset, but will be a "pointer" to the dataset on disk.  This
                approach allows for multiple users to use a single (possibly very large) dataset file.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p/>
    <li><strong>Server</strong>
        <p/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Reload a tool's configuration</strong> - allows a new version of a tool to be loaded while the server is running
            </li>
            <p/>
            <li>
                <strong>Profile memory usage</strong> - measures system memory used for certain Galaxy functions
            </li>
            <p/>
            <li>
                <strong>Manage jobs</strong> - displays all jobs that are currently not finished (i.e., their state is new, waiting, queued, or
                running).  Administrators are able to cleanly stop long-running jobs. 
            </li>

<p><strong>Data Security and Data Libraries</strong></p>
<p/>
<strong>Security</strong> - Data security in Galaxy is a new feature, so familiarize yourself with the details which can be found 
here or in our <a href="http://g2.trac.bx.psu.edu/wiki/SecurityFeatures" target="_blank">data security page</a>.  The data security 
process incorporates users, groups and roles, and enables the application of certain permissions on datasets, specifically "access"
and "manage permissions".  By default, the "manage permissions" permission is associated with the dataset owner's private role, and
the "access" permission is not set, making the dataset public.  With these default permissions, users should not see any difference
in the way Galaxy has behaved in the past.
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Users</strong> - registered Galaxy users that have created a Galaxy account.  Users can belong to groups and can
        be associated with 1 or more roles.  If a user is not authenticated during a Galaxy session, they will not have access to any 
        of the security features, and datasets they create during that session will have no permissions applied to them (i.e., they
        will be considered "public", and no one will be allowed to change permissions on them).
    </li>
    <p/>
    <li>
        <strong>Groups</strong> - a set of 0 or more users which are considered members of the group.  Groups can be associated with 0
        or more roles, simplifying the process of applying permissions to the data between a select group of users.
    </li>
    <p/>
    <li>
        <strong>Roles</strong> - associate users and groups with specific permissions on datasets.  For example, users in groups A and B 
        can be associated with role C which gives them the "access" permission on datasets D, E and F.  Roles have a type which is currently
        one of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>private</strong> - every user is associated automatically with their own private role.  Administrators cannot 
                manage private roles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>user</strong> - this is currently not used, but eventually any registered user will be able to create a new role
                and this will be it's type.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>sharing</strong> - a role created automatically during a Galaxy session that enables a user to share data with 
                another user.  This can generally be considered a temporary role.
            </li>
            <li><strong>admin</strong> - a role created by a Galaxy administrator.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p/>
    <li>
        <strong>Dataset Permissions</strong> - applying the following permissions will to a dataset will result in the behavior described.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>access</strong> - users associated with the role can import this dataset into their history for analysis.
                <p>
                    If no roles with the "access" permission are associated with a dataset, the dataset is "public" and may be accessed by
                    anyone.  Public data library datasets will be accessible to all users (as well as anyone not logged in during a Galaxy session)
                    from the list of data libraries displayed when the "Data Libraries" menu item is selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Associating a dataset with a role that includes the "access" permission restricts the set of users that can access it.  
                    For example, if 'Role A' includes the "access" permission and 'Role A' is associated with the dataset, only those users
                    and groups who are associated with 'Role A' may access the dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If multiple roles that include the "access" permission are associated with a dataset, access to the dataset is derived
                    from the intersection of the users associated with the roles.  For example, if 'Role A' and 'Role B' are associated with
                    a dataset, only those users and groups who are associated with both 'Role A' AND 'Role B' may access the dataset.  When
                    the "access" permission is applied to a dataset, Galaxy checks to make sure that at least 1 user belongs to all groups and
                    roles associated with the "access" permission (otherwise the dataset would be restricted from everyone).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for a user to make a dataset private (i.e., only they can access it), they should associate the dataset with
                    their private role (the role identical to their Galaxy user name / email address).  Associating additional roles that
                    include the "access" permission is not possible, since it would render the dataset inaccessible to everyone.  To make
                    a dataset private to themselves and one or more other users, the user can create a new role and associate the dataset
                    with that role, not their "private role".  Galaxy makes this easy by telling the user they are about to share a private
                    dataset and giving them the option of doing so.  If they respond positively, the sharing role is automatically created
                    for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private data (data associated with roles that include the "access" permission) must be made public in order to be used
                    with external applications like the "view at UCSC" link, or the "Perform genome analysis and prediction with EpiGRAPH" 
                    tool.  Being made publically accessible means removing the association of all roles that include the "access" permission
                    from the dataset.
                <p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>manage permissions</strong> - Role members can manage the permissions applied to this dataset</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
