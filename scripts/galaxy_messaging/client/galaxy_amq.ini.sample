# Galaxy Message Queue
# Galaxy uses AMQ protocol to receive messages from external sources like 
# bar code scanners. Galaxy has been tested against RabbitMQ AMQP implementation.
# For Galaxy to receive messages from a message queue the RabbitMQ server has 
# to be set up with a user account and other parameters listed below. The 'host'
# and 'port' fields should point to where the RabbitMQ server is running. 

#[galaxy:amqp]

#exchange = galaxy_exchange
#routing_key = bar_code_scanner

# The following section(s) 'scanner#' is for specifying the state of the 
# sample this scanner represents. This state name should be one of the 
# possible states created for this request type in Galaxy
# If there multiple scanners attached to this host the add as many "scanner#"
# sections below each with the name & prefix of the bar code scanner and 
# the state it represents
