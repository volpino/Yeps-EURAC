After clicking the **Execute** button, you will be redirected to the EpiGRAPH website. Please be patient while the dataset is being imported. Inside EpiGRAPH, buttons are available to send the results of the EpiGRAPH analysis back to Galaxy. In addition, you can always abandon an EpiGRAPH session and return to Galaxy by directing your browser to your current Galaxy instance.

**EpiGRAPH outline**

The EpiGRAPH_ web service enables biologists to uncover hidden associations in vertebrate genome and epigenome datasets. Users can upload or import sets of genomic regions and EpiGRAPH will test a wide range of attributes (including DNA sequence and structure, gene density, chromatin modifications and evolutionary conservation) for enrichment or depletion among these regions. Furthermore, EpiGRAPH learns to predictively identify genomic regions that exhibit similar properties.
